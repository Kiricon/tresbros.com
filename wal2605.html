			On-site investigation of this terrible tragedy was conducted under the auspices of Servicio a La Navegacion en el Espacio Aereo Mexicano (SENEAM), the Mexican equivalent of the FAA.
			 Their conclusion?&nbsp; &quot;Error de Pilotos.&quot;&nbsp;
			 Yet, serious faults were committed during this &quot;official&quot; investigation.&nbsp; 
			 No U.S. investigator was allowed on the crash site nor allowed to investigate the wreckage or airport facilities.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			 What did those with a vested interest have to hide?
